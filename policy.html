    <p>
        1. Purpose 
Native Bush Spice Australia adopts a standard approach to project management to ensure the consistent use of project management procedures and templates. 

This policy and procedure is designed to specify the requirements for managing projects to ensure that project scope is articulated, stakeholders are involved, risks are managed, and project benefits are maximized. 

This policy and procedure applies to all projects. 


2. Types of project
Generally, there are three types of project: small project, medium project and large project which is determined through the project amount. 

In each of the above cases the following staff are to be involved. 

Small Project (under $10,000)
•Project Manager 
•Project team member (generally the Customer Service Officer)
•Senior management team to approve project management scope plan and kept informed of progress. 

Medium Project ($10,000 - $50,000)
•Project Manager 
•Project team member (generally the Customer Service Officer)
•Senior Manager to be regularly updated on progress
•Senior management team to approve project management scope plan and kept informed of progress. 

Large Project ($50,000 plus)
•Project Manager (Senior Manager)
•Project team member (Senior Manager)
•Project Steering Group

Project staff will vary depending on the type of project. 


3. Project Phases 
All projects should progress through the following project phases. 

Stage one 
Stage one of the project management process is triggered when a staff member or team identifies the need to solve a problem, improve a process or implement a new service. It defines what the project will attempt to achieve based on appropriate business justification. 
At this stage, the staff member or team must complete the project authorisation template to gain authorisation for the detailed project scope management planning. 

Stage two
Stage two of the project management includes defining and documenting the project scope in the project scope management plan.
Key tasks involved in this phase include:
Identifying project benefits, outcomes and outputs
Making an initial assessment of project size and required staff.
Completing a project scoping using the Native Bush Spices Australia project scope template. 
The project scope management plan must be completed within 2 weeks of the project authorisation being given approval. 
The project scope management plan must be reviewed by the senior management team prior to final approval. Where any issues are identified from the project management plan scoping, it is possible that the project may not proceed. 

Stage three
The purpose of this phase is to determine how the project will be executed. This means developing a project management plan based on the project scope. The Australian Native Bush Spice project management template should be use. Essentially the preparation of a detailed model of the work required to achieve the project objectives is required and confirmation of the budget and project arrangements suggested in the Business Case. Risks are also defined and documented in a risk management plan A detailed schedule is also prepared. 

Stage four
The purpose of this phase is to implement the project. Regular reports of the progress of the project should be provided to relevant staff, as well as regular meetings as outlined in the project management plan. 

Stage five
This is the final phase of the project and is the formal closure of the delivery component of the project. It has two main outcomes: 
The handover of project outputs to the operational areas responsible for ongoing support and maintenance (if applicable to the project); and 
The evaluation of the success of the project 

The evaluation of the success of the project is important part of the project. The actual project outcomes and cost must be compared with the planned outcomes and determine whether what was achieved by the project was worth the amount invested.
Project recommendations to be included in project evaluation report should include a recommendation to close project.



4. Project Communication 
It is expected that the project team meet at least weekly depending on the size of the project. A brief email summarising the meeting outcomes must be sent to senior management.
Weekly reports must also be sent to senior management regarding project progress. 
All project issues arising must be documented in the project issues register. 


5. Project record keeping
A project folder is to be established for each project. The overall folder should be the name of the project e.g. Human Resources Information System Project and sub-folders should be created including folders for the business case, project management plan, project reports, minutes and any other relevant folders e.g. briefs to contractors. All documents should include the version number, date and title of document. 


6. Project change requests
Changes to a project's scope should be handled as described:
1.Change request initiated and documented in a Change Request Form
2.The request should be investigated initially by the project team member and importantly should be able to define the business value to the project.
3.The Operations Manager will then analyse if the change is feasible and give the initial approval to proceed.
4.Any changes will need to be recorded and the WBS updated if required. 
5.If no changes approved, then this should still be logged.
6.Appropriate changes to the budget should also be incorporated if relevant
The project definition should be updated if the approved scope change results in a substantial change to the overall project.
